  <h2>Sugar Cookie Recipe:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>preheat oven to 350</li>
    <li>In the bowl of your mixer cream butter and sugar until smooth, at least 3 minutes</li>
    <li>Beat in extracts and egg.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl combine baking powder and salt  with flour and add a little at a time to the wet ingredients. The dough will be very stiff. If it becomes too stiff for your mixer turn out the dough onto a countertop surface. Wet your hands and finish off kneading the dough by hand.</li>
    <li>DO NOT CHILL THE DOUGH. Divide into workable batches, roll out onto a floured surface and cut. You want these cookies to be on the thicker side (closer to 1/4 inch rather than 1/8).</li>
    <li>Bake at 350 for 6-8 minutes. Let cool on the cookie sheet until firm enough to transfer to a cooling rack.</li>
  </ol>
